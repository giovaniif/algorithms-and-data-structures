## The purpose
I have created this repository to have a record of my studies about *algorithms* and data structures as so as some other 'college subjects' and *low-level* stuff that we do not learn in technical courses and on **Medium** posts. I hope it can also help other people that are also trying to learn such things

[Here](https://www.notion.so/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-f66c4a2c9db744ceaa2c6f08c066b0fa) is a link to my Notion with all my notes and thoughts about each 'theme' on this repo and also some other related stuff
